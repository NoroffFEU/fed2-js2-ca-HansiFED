 * @function deletePost
 * @description
 * This function prompts the user for confirmation before deleting a post.
 * If confirmed, it sends a DELETE request to the API with the post's ID obtained
 * from the URL parameters. Upon deletion, it redirects the user
 * to the homepage and logs a success message. If the deletion fails or an error occurs,
 * it logs the corresponding error message.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} Returns a promise that resolves to `true` if the post
 * was deleted successfully, or `false` if the deletion failed or was canceled.
